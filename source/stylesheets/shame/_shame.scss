// ==========================================================================
// The idea of a shame file is to create a specific place/stylesheet specifically reserved for quick fixes, hacks,
// and/or questionable css code we will inevitablly write in order to meet tight deadlines. We are all forced to
// write shameful code, this is not meant to shame developers, rather it is meant to make the team aware of hacky
// code that we'll inevitably have to write and help us control it.

// ==========================================================================
// Here's Why:
// ==========================================================================
// 1. You make them stick out like a sore thumb
// 2. You keep your main codebase clean
// 3. You make developers aware that their hacks are made very visible
// 4. You make them easier to isolate and fix.
// 5. $ git blame shame.css

// ==========================================================================
// The Rules:
// ==========================================================================
// 1. If it's a hack, it goes in _shame.scss
// 2. Document all hacks fully
// 		a. What part of the code base does it relate to?
// 		b. Why was this needed?
// 		c. How does this fix it?
// 		d. How might you fix it properly, given more time?
// 3. Do not blame the developer; if they explained why they had to do it then their reasons are probably valid.
// 4. Try and clean up _shame.scss when you have down time.
// 		a. even better, get a tech debt story in asana and actually get time to resolve it.

// ==========================================================================
// An Example:
// ==========================================================================
// Nav specificity fix.
//
// Someone used an ID in the header code (#header a{}) which trumps the
// nav selectors (.site-nav a{}). Use !important to override it until I
// have time to refactor the header stuff.

// .site-nav a {
// 	color:#BADA55!important;
// }
